Feature: Run health-check against registered proxies.

    Background:
        Given request JWT token is valid admin token

    Scenario: Request health-checks statuses
        Given request JSON payload '{"name":"example-ok","active":true,"proxy":{"preserve_host":false,"listen_path":"/example-ok/*","upstreams": {"balancing": "roundrobin", "targets": [{"target": "http://localhost:9089/hello-world"}]},"strip_path":false,"append_path":false,"enable_load_balancing":false,"methods":["GET"]},"health_check":{"url":"http://localhost:9089/status-ok"}}'
        When I request "/apis" API path with "POST" method
        Then I should receive 201 response code

        When I request "/status" API path with "GET" method
        Then I should receive 200 response code
        And response JSON body has "system" path
        And response JSON body has "status" path with value 'OK'
        And response JSON body has "timestamp" path
